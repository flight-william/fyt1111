faqs:
  - q: "How many Ah Fu stickers are there?"
    a: "The WeChat sticker pack contains 40 original designs. They include iconic expressions like Fearless, GO Superman, X TALK, BUSY, BYE, Call Me, and RICHE, as well as everyday emotions like crying, angry, happy, and proud."
  - q: "When were the Ah Fu stickers created?"
    a: "December 2015, designed in-house by the FYTBET (富易堂) creative team. This was the first batch of social media expressions for brand mascot Ah Fu, released the same year the character was born."
  - q: "Why would an online betting brand create a sticker pack?"
    a: "FYTBET has always operated as a community, not just a platform. VIP WeChat groups are where high-value customers interact daily. Stickers let the brand blend into conversations in a fun, organic way. When members use Ah Fu to trash-talk or celebrate, the brand spreads — not as advertising, but as social currency. This kind of brand IP investment is remarkably rare in the online sportsbook industry."
  - q: "What makes Ah Fu's design distinctive?"
    a: "Ah Fu is a cartoon boy with a signature large brown swirl hairstyle, big expressive eyes, and a chubby build. He wears red suspenders with the 富 character on his chest. The 40+ stickers show him in wildly different scenarios — as a caped superman, in a business suit, in swimwear on holiday, as a student, even as a mysterious shadow figure. Each pose has attitude and tells a story."
  - q: "Can these stickers still be downloaded?"
    a: "The WeChat sticker pack was shared organically through VIP member groups. Today these designs are preserved as part of the brand heritage archive, showcasing FYTBET's long-term investment in brand IP — from 2015 stickers to anniversary mugs, 3D modeling, and animation production, the Ah Fu design library continues to grow."
