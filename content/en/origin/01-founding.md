FYT launched at 11:11:11 AM on November 11, 2011 — the once-in-a-century "Century Singles' Day." A timestamp you don't forget, and neither did the brand.

Born under the Cube group alongside 188BET, FYT started with Isle of Man and PAGCOR dual licenses from day one. The compliance foundation was laid before the doors even opened.
