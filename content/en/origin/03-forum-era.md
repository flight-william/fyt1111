When Chinese forums were the internet, FYT was there — Tianchao, Wanbet, Huaren, Betboy, Haiyan. Not buying banner ads, but joining conversations, responding to feedback, running community events. Trust earned the old-fashioned way.

The brand evolved from 富易堂 Riche88 to FYTBET. The tagline went from "Want to win? It's not hard at all!" to "Where betting becomes entertainment" — a shift from pure competition to a broader vision. Fifteen years on, the look has changed; the commitment to members hasn't.
