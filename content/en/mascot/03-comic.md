Beyond stickers and merchandise, the design team created a comic series for Ah Fu — stories of Ah Fu and his friend on the court, capturing the bond between the brand and sports in a lighthearted style. The RICHE88 logo appears naturally in every panel, not as product placement, but as part of Ah Fu's world.
