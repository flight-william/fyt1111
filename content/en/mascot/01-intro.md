Ah Fu arrived in 2015 — brown swirl hair, red suspenders, the character "富" on his chest. Part mascot, part brand signature. If you know Ah Fu, you know FYT.

He's shown up at VIP events, charity matches, and in the social sticker sets that members use daily. Not a corporate mascot — more like an inside joke that only the community gets.
