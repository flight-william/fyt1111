Your data security and experience are non-negotiable. FYT's entire system is built in-house — front-end, back-end, infrastructure, end to end. No third-party shells, no white-label shortcuts. When the code is ours, your information stays safe.

In-house development also means we build what members actually need. Fortune Insurance is the proof — 100% betting insurance where you keep your winnings, and losses are returned the next day. No one else offers this because it requires ground-up engineering. Four sportsbooks under one roof: XJ (188BET legacy), Pinnacle (sharpest global odds), InPlay Matrix (live-betting specialists), and PM Sports — compare everything in one place.
