The VIP way started in Macau. Working alongside Juxing's concierge team taught FYT what real hospitality looks like — and that DNA now runs through everything the platform does, online and off.

For New Year, VIP members received a limited edition Haig Club Scotch whisky — the Beckham-endorsed brand. The choice of gift says everything about how the brand sees its guests.
