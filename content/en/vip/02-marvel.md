VIP gifting went beyond Haig Club. FYT offered active members a Marvel hero collector series — officially licensed Dragon models of Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, and Hulk. Each figure was limited edition, earned through turnover milestones. A thank you that sits on your shelf, not in your spam folder.

From limited-edition whisky to Marvel figures, gold-foil playing cards to anniversary mugs — every gift is curated, not mass-produced. It's not promotion. It's the quiet understanding between a brand and the people who trust it.
