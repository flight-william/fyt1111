faqs:
  - q: "What does the FYTBET brand archive contain?"
    a: "The brand archive is a complete record of FYTBET's fifteen years of brand building, covering the Ah Fu mascot design archive (40+ expressions, sports series, idiom illustrations, 3D sculpts, animation, brand guidelines), visual identity evolution, logo design archive, and more."
  - q: "Why publish a brand archive?"
    a: "Fifteen years of work piles up — sketches, timelines, guidelines full of little details. We never planned to keep them hidden. Rather than letting everything sit on a hard drive collecting dust, we figured we'd lay it all out and let people see what we've actually been making all these years."
  - q: "Will the brand archive be updated?"
    a: "Yes. What you see now is just the first batch. Fifteen years of design assets, event footage, and product iteration records are being organized — the Logo evolution archive, Zhao Yun Index match prediction archive, behind-the-scenes event footage, and more sections will go live progressively. The archive only gets thicker."
