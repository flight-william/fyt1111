["The Forgotten Children"](/docs/forgotten-children.pdf) — this documentary report's title was also the starting point of FYT's charitable mission. The team traveled deep into rural China, donating funds to schools, delivering cooking oil, rice, and daily necessities to families in need. Wearing charity t-shirts printed with "Spread the Love," they crossed mountains to hand school bags, footballs, crayons, and stationery directly to children.

This was not remote donation — it was hands-on action. The team walked into remote villages, along muddy paths, to homes that rarely see outside visitors. Vans loaded with Sichuan specialty cooking oil and rice were tangible expressions of the brand's social commitment. The smiles on children's faces when receiving new school bags and stationery are a return no commercial success can replace.
