## What Makes FYT's VIP Service Special? Built for the Few, Not the Many

FYT has never been a platform chasing user volume.

Since its founding in 2011, the brand has operated around a single organizing principle: **concentrate every resource on the people who know the game best**. The selection of product lines, the composition of the service team, the architecture of the rewards system — none of these decisions start with "how do we acquire more users." They start with "how do we make the experience better for the members we already have."

This VIP-first philosophy traces directly to the brand's roots with the Juxing Group in Macau. The concierge culture of Macau's VIP rooms — where fewer guests mean deeper service — was absorbed into FYT's operational DNA and carried forward into the digital realm. The venue changed. The standard did not.

## What Sportsbooks Does FYT Offer? Four Engines Compared

Sports betting is FYT's core competency, and the platform delivers it in a way that is genuinely rare in the industry — **four independent sportsbook engines running side by side**, each with its own strengths, each setting its own odds.

- **XJ Sports (小金体育)** — The branded sportsbook of 188BET, carrying years of accumulated data, odds expertise, and market depth. This is the foundational product, backed by one of the most recognized names in Asian sports betting.
- **Pinnacle** — Globally respected as the benchmark for sharp lines, Pinnacle offers some of the lowest margins and highest limits in the world. It is the go-to choice for professional bettors and experienced punters who demand precision in pricing.
- **InPlay Matrix** — Purpose-built for live and in-play betting, InPlay Matrix excels in speed of odds adjustment and depth of real-time market coverage. For members who thrive on the momentum of a match in progress, this engine delivers.
- **PM Sports (Panda Group)** — Panda Group's sportsbook offering brings a differentiated perspective to event coverage and market construction, providing an alternative angle that complements the other three engines.

Four engines, four independent odds boards. For any given match, members can compare four sets of lines before placing a bet. The decision — which engine, which odds, which market — always stays with the player. This design philosophy, where choice itself is a form of respect, is VIP thinking made tangible.

## What Is Fortune Insurance? 100% Sports Betting Insurance Explained

**Fortune Insurance (富贵保)** is FYT's proprietary 100% sports betting insurance product — and there is virtually nothing else like it in the market.

The mechanism is straightforward. When Fortune Insurance is activated on a qualifying bet: if the bet wins, the full profit is credited as normal. If the bet loses, the insured portion of the stake is returned to the member's account the following day. Not as a rebate percentage. Not as a bonus coupon. As **actual principal, returned in full**.

Behind this product is a fully in-house technology stack. Fortune Insurance is not a third-party plugin or a white-label feature purchased from a vendor. FYT's engineering team built it from the ground up — the underlying logic, the risk model, the front-end integration, everything. Its existence serves as both a product innovation and a direct proof point of the platform's self-developed technical capability.

For the VIP member, Fortune Insurance changes more than the outcome of a single wager. It changes the texture of the entire betting experience — replacing anxiety with composure, and turning a calculated risk into a more measured proposition.

## What Exclusive Perks Do VIP Customers Get? Haig Club Whisky & Limited Collectibles

FYT's approach to VIP gifting has never followed the logic of promotional giveaways.

When the New Year arrived, VIP members received a bottle of **Haig Club limited-edition Scotch whisky** — the David Beckham-endorsed brand — with a card carrying the brand motto: **"In all things great and small, true wealth lies in contentment"** (小大由之 富在知足). The choice of gift says everything about how the brand sees its guests.

The collectible program carried the same philosophy. **Marvel officially licensed Dragon collector figurines** — Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk — were issued in limited quantities, earned through active engagement milestones. Each Lunar New Year brought a **zodiac-edition golden Ah Fu figurine** — Golden Horse, Golden Goat, Golden Monkey — a new edition every year, reserved exclusively for VIP members. Custom gold-foil playing cards, branded watch bands, anniversary mugs — each piece was selected with intention and given freely, never sold.

What unites every item in this gifting tradition is a single quality: you cannot buy them elsewhere. They belong only to the people the platform has chosen to remember.

## What Payment Methods Does FYT Support? Seven Channels from USDT to e-CNY

For VIP customers, the core requirement for payments comes down to two things: **speed** and **comfort**.

FYT supports seven payment channels, spanning the full range from traditional banking to cutting-edge digital currency:

- **USDT** — Cryptocurrency channel offering borderless transactions and strong privacy
- **Alipay (支付宝)** — China's leading mobile payment platform
- **WeChat Pay (微信支付)** — The default payment choice within China's dominant social ecosystem
- **Digital Yuan (e-CNY)** — China's official central bank digital currency, representing the future of sovereign digital finance
- **GBPay (购宝)** — Third-party payment platform
- **EBpay** — Third-party payment platform
- **Bank Transfer** — Traditional bank-to-bank channel, stable and reliable

Seven channels running in parallel means the member never has to adapt to the platform — the platform adapts to the member. Whether you prefer the anonymity of cryptocurrency, the convenience of Alipay and WeChat Pay, or the forward-looking nature of the digital yuan, deposits and withdrawals happen through the method you are most comfortable with.

This breadth of payment infrastructure is not accidental. It reflects a VIP service philosophy that extends beyond the product itself: remove friction wherever possible, and let the member's preference dictate the experience.

## What Is Juxing? FYT's Macau VIP Lounge Partnership DNA

The DNA of FYT's VIP service can be traced to one source: the brand's partnership with **Juxing Group (钜星)** in Macau.

Juxing is a Macau-based VIP room operator with deep roots in high-value guest reception and concierge services. Through this collaboration, FYT absorbed a set of hospitality principles forged in the physical VIP rooms of one of the world's great gaming destinations — principles built not on lavish decor, but on **reading each guest's needs precisely and consistently exceeding their expectations**.

Those principles were subsequently encoded into the brand's operating logic. The way the customer service team responds. The care that goes into designing the rewards program. The criteria used to prioritize product features. The experiential events — the Macau Tower bungy jump, the Singapore F1 circuit drive — all grew from the same VIP room philosophy: create moments for your guests that cannot be replicated elsewhere.

A physical VIP room has geographical limits. The standard of care it represents does not. That standard now lives in every product decision and service detail across the FYT platform — a Macau heritage, delivered digitally, with the same weight it always carried.
