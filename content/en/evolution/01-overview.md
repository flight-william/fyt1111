Fifteen years, five redesigns — each one driven by the same question: how do we make the experience better for our members? From the original grey-blue to a rich red-gold era, then bold black-orange, an all-orange experiment — ultimately returning to refined black-orange. No chasing trends. Just relentless refinement for the people who use it every day.
