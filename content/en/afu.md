faqs:
  - q: "When was Ah Fu designed?"
    a: "Ah Fu was born in 2015, created from scratch by FYT's in-house design team. The team went through 40+ iterations before finalizing the signature look — oversized brown swirl hair, red suspenders, and the character 富 (wealth) on his chest."
  - q: "How many Ah Fu expressions exist?"
    a: "Over 40 unique sticker expressions, covering 'Fearless', 'Call Me', 'GO', 'BUSY', 'BYE', 'X TALK' and many more everyday scenarios. Each expression was individually designed with no two emotions repeated."
  - q: "What are Ah Fu's signature design features?"
    a: "The iconic oversized brown swirl hairstyle, large expressive eyes, red suspenders with the 富 character prominently displayed. The 富 is a direct reference to the brand name 富易堂 and symbolizes prosperity in Chinese culture."
  - q: "What design categories does the Ah Fu archive cover?"
    a: "Eight categories: WeChat sticker pack (40+ versions), sports series (#88 jersey), idiom education series (20+ illustrations), original panel comics, 3D sculpt/figurine, animation production (89 hand-drawn frames), event design assets, and brand visual identity guidelines."
  - q: "What is the relationship between Ah Fu and FYTBET?"
    a: "Ah Fu is the official brand mascot of FYTBET (formerly Riche88/富易堂), created in 2015 by the brand's in-house design team. Every Ah Fu design — from WeChat stickers to 3D figurines, from charity events to brand guidelines — was produced by FYT's own team, making Ah Fu a core component of the brand's proprietary intellectual property."
  - q: "How was the Ah Fu animation produced?"
    a: "The Ah Fu Little Apple dance animation was hand-drawn frame by frame — 89 frames total, with the RICHE88 brand identity integrated into the stage backdrop. Additional works include the football running loop animation, demonstrating the team's end-to-end motion production capability."
  - q: "Does Ah Fu have official brand guidelines?"
    a: "Yes. Ah Fu has a complete visual identity spec including approved color palettes, typography standards, and explicit prohibited usage examples (a 'Do Not' list). After creating so many designs over the years, the team naturally started worrying — what if someone stretches the proportions or swaps the colors? So they wrote the rules down, clearly laying out what's allowed and what isn't."

## The Birth of a Brand Symbol: A Decade-Long Creation Story

In 2015, the FYT design team set out to create a symbol that would belong entirely to the brand. This was not an outsourced commercial project but an in-house effort by a team that understood the brand's spirit, building from zero over several months.

Their objective was clear: give the brand a face.

That face needed to be distinctive enough to be recognized instantly, warm enough that people would want to use it and share it, and versatile enough to work across stickers, animation, 3D figurines, and event materials.

The result was **Ah Fu**. Brown swirl hair, red suspenders, the character 富 on his chest — a design that has remained unchanged since 2015, enduring a full decade without becoming dated. What follows is the complete record of the Ah Fu design archive.

## WeChat Sticker Pack: The Organic Spread of 40+ Original Expressions

Stickers were Ah Fu's first point of contact with users. In 2015, the design team created over 40 independent expressions, each mapped to a specific social scenario:

**"Fearless"** conveys confidence, **"Call Me"** signals availability, **"GO"** is the action-hero taking flight, **"BUSY"** politely deflects, **"BYE"** exits gracefully, **"X TALK"** declares silence…

These stickers were never promoted through paid channels. They spread organically through VIP member WeChat groups. When a sticker pack is good enough, it finds its own distribution — the most honest test of design quality.

## Sports Series: The #88 Jersey and Sportsbook DNA

Ah Fu wearing the #88 jersey is the visual expression of FYT's sportsbook heritage. 88 is both the brand's code number and an auspicious homophone for "prosperity" in Chinese culture. The Manchester United tribute colorway honors the brand's earliest connections to the football world.

## Idiom Education Series: "Ah Fu's Unanswered Questions Channel"

This is the most culturally rich segment of the Ah Fu design system.

**"Three Men Make a Tiger," "Cover the Sky with One Hand," "A Drop in the Ocean," "Ten Lines at a Glance"…** The design team created 20+ original illustrations themed around traditional Chinese idioms, presented under the "Ah Fu's Unanswered Questions Channel" banner.

Each illustration places Ah Fu as the protagonist within the idiom's narrative, bringing ancient wisdom to life through vivid, exaggerated storytelling. This approach elevates the brand beyond commercial identity into genuine cultural content creation.

## Original Comics: From Single Frame to Sequential Storytelling

Ah Fu's panel comics use the basketball court as their primary setting, weaving the RICHE88 brand identity naturally into the visual narrative. Unlike single-frame stickers, these comics demonstrate the team's complete storytelling ability — narrative rhythm, panel composition, and brand integration working in harmony.

---

## 3D Sculpt & Figurine: The Leap from 2D to 3D

Ah Fu's 3D model is the most technically demanding piece in the archive. The team completed a full turnaround render — front, side, and back — to production-grade figurine standards. This is not a concept sketch but an industrial-ready model.

---

## Animation Production: 89 Hand-Drawn Frames of Commitment

The Ah Fu Little Apple dance animation is among the team's most labor-intensive works. 89 individually hand-drawn frames — each a complete image with unique movement, expression, and background detail. The RICHE88 brand identity is embedded in the stage set, blending promotion with content creation seamlessly.

## Brand Guidelines: Ah Fu's "Instruction Manual"

After years of drawing Ah Fu, the team started worrying about one thing: what if people misuse the design?

Wrong colors, stretched proportions, placed in the wrong context — it had actually happened before. So the team sat down and wrote it all out: approved color palettes (exact values, permitted combinations), typography standards, and a **prohibited usage list (the "Do Not" list)** — what colors can't be paired, what distortions aren't allowed, what contexts don't fit.

At the end of the day, they just couldn't bear to see something they'd drawn for ten years get mangled.
