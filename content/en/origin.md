## When Was FYT Founded? The 11.11.11 Century Singles' Day Origin

November 11, 2011. Six elevens converging into a single moment — 11/11/11 at 11:11:11 AM. The Chinese internet christened it **Century Singles' Day** (世纪光棍节), a numerical alignment that occurs precisely once every hundred years. At that exact instant, **FYT** was born.

The choice was deliberate. The founding team understood that in the age of digital culture, a sufficiently memorable birthday becomes its own marketing asset — a permanent anchor in collective memory. More than a decade later, when people talk about FYT, "11.11.11" is invariably the first thing mentioned.

## What Is the Relationship Between FYT and 188BET? The Cube Group Lineage

FYT was never a scrappy startup finding its footing. From day one, it carried the full weight of an established international gaming operation.

The **Cube group** was a comprehensive gaming operator headquartered in the Isle of Man, best known for its flagship brand **188BET**. Across Asia and Europe, 188BET had sponsored Premier League clubs Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic, building brand recognition that spanned continents.

Incubated within the Cube ecosystem, FYT launched with immediate access to:

- **Technology infrastructure** battle-tested at scale across millions of users
- **Regulatory compliance expertise** spanning multiple jurisdictions
- **Industry talent and operational knowledge** accumulated through 188BET's years of operation

This heritage allowed FYT to bypass the trial-and-error phase that most new brands endure, entering the market with the operational maturity of an established platform.

## What Licenses Does FYT Hold? Isle of Man + PAGCOR Dual Regulation

In an industry where trust is the fundamental currency, regulatory credentials form the bedrock of brand credibility.

The Cube group held two heavyweight licenses:

- **Isle of Man** — One of the world's most rigorous gaming regulatory frameworks, with standards covering financial transparency, technical security, anti-money laundering compliance, and player protection
- **PAGCOR (Philippines)** — The Asia-Pacific region's primary gaming regulator, covering both online and land-based operations

Two distinct regulatory jurisdictions, each with its own oversight mechanisms, created a layered compliance architecture.

This was not merely paperwork — it represented multiple tiers of protection for player funds, operational transparency, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

## Which Forums Was FYT Active On? The Grassroots Community Era

Before social media dominated digital communication, the heart of the Chinese-language gaming community beat in **forums**.

FYT cultivated a deep presence across five major community platforms:

- **Tianchao Forum (天朝论坛)** — The leading Chinese gaming discussion community of its time
- **Huaren Forum (华人论坛)** — Where overseas Chinese users gathered
- **Haiyan Forum (海燕论坛)** — Known for its seasoned player base
- **Boren Forum (博人论坛)** — A specialized gaming discussion community
- **Wanbet Forum (玩博论坛)** — A comprehensive gaming discussion platform

On these forums, FYT did not appear as an advertiser broadcasting messages. Instead, the brand showed up as a **community participant** — answering user questions, joining discussions, organizing forum events. This grassroots approach built a form of trust that is nearly impossible to manufacture: users knew the brand team was present, accessible, and engaged in real conversation.

The forum era has passed, but the reputation foundation it established remains a vital part of FYT's brand identity to this day.

## Are Riche88 and FYTBET the Same Brand? The 2020 Rebrand Explained

In its early years, the brand operated as **Riche88** (富易堂). "Riche" drew from the French word for wealth, paired with "88" — a number that symbolizes fortune and prosperity in Chinese culture. The name precisely conveyed the brand's DNA: **wealth, luck, and refinement**.

On April 21, 2020, the brand underwent its most significant transformation since founding — officially rebranding to **FYTBET**.

This was far more than a name change. It was a comprehensive brand evolution:

- The visual system shifted from its early grey-and-blue palette to a more distinctive **black and orange** combination
- A new **FB monogram icon** was introduced as the primary brand mark
- Brand positioning pivoted from a traditional gaming platform toward a **VIP entertainment experience**

The three letters "FYT" preserve the pinyin abbreviation of 富易堂, while "BET" directly signals the core business — clean, international, yet rooted in Chinese heritage.

## How Has the FYT Tagline Changed? From "Not Hard at All" to "Make BC Entertainment"

A brand's tagline is its philosophy distilled into a single breath. The evolution of FYT's tagline traces the brand's intellectual maturation.

The original tagline — **"Want to win? It's not hard at all!"** (要赢？一点都不难！) — pulsed with the energy and ambition of a young brand. Its message was clear: dare to try, and victory is within reach. This philosophy later became the spiritual engine behind the brand's experiential events — whether it was the 233-meter bungy jump at Macau Tower or driving on the Singapore F1 street circuit, every event was a living embodiment of "it's not hard at all."

The current tagline — **"Make BC entertainment"** (让BC成为娱乐) — represents a different kind of maturity. It no longer fixates on the outcome of winning or losing, but redirects attention to **the quality of the experience itself**. This shift mirrors the broader industry trajectory: as technology and products mature, true differentiation comes from the **entertainment value and emotional resonance** that a platform delivers.

From challenge to entertainment, from outcome to experience — over more than a decade, FYT has completed the philosophical evolution from a bold young brand to a mature, experience-centered platform.
