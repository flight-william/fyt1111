# Project "Gold Mine": 15-Year Authority Empire
**Strategic Master Plan for FYTBET/Riche88 Ecosystem (2026 World Cup Edition)**

## 1. Executive Summary: The Authority Inversion
Stop viewing blocked domains as "broken." They are your **Nuclear Deterrent**. In an industry of "fly-by-night" sites, your cumulative **150+ years of domain age** is an unfair advantage that money cannot buy. We will use these **Anchors** to collect authority and "bless" unblocked **Vessels** to reach the China audience.

---

## 2. The "Anchor vs. Vessel" Strategy (China Survival)
This is the core architecture for dominating a restricted market:

### A. The Anchors (Permanent | High Trust | Often Blocked)
*   **Domains:** `hupu.info`, `riche88.com`, `riche88.net`, `000aa.com`, `nice3.com`, `riche99.com`.
*   **Role:** The "SEO Bank." They collect PageRank, historical authority, and E-E-A-T.
*   **Action:** They never change. They serve as the **Canonical Master** for the entire empire.

### B. The Vessels (Disposable | High Access | Unblocked)
*   **Domains:** New, cheap registrations (e.g., `fyt88.xyz`, `riche-go.top`).
*   **Role:** The "Interface." They deliver content to the user inside China.
*   **Action:** They host the frontend but point their `<link rel="canonical">` back to the Anchors. If blocked, discard and rotate to a new domain.

---

## 3. Tier 1: The Sovereign Core (Heritage & Canonical Anchor)
*   **`riche88.com` (15 Years) — The Museum:** Heritage, Charity, Mascot. Establishes the "Since 2011" proof.
*   **`riche99.com` (15 Years) — The Integrity Vault:** Scans of physical licenses and 15-year payout logs. Proves solvency.

---

## 4. Tier 2: The Knowledge Engine (Long-Tail & Support)
*   **`riche88.net` (15 Years) — The FAQ / Line Detection Hub:**
    *   **The Pivot:** A "Pure FAQ" site covering thousands of long-tail crypto/technical keywords.
    *   **The Edge:** Acts as the "Official Domain Registry" and "Line Tester" to direct users to unblocked mirrors.

---

## 5. Tier 3: The Traffic Harvesters (Organic & Stealth)
*   **`fytpress.com` (New | Clean) — The Newsroom:** Dominates 2026 World Cup keywords without betting terms. Bridges fans to the brand story.
*   **`caca818.com` (11 Years | Clean) — The Lifestyle Bridge:** The "Safe" link for social media bios. Home of "Ah Fu" comics and community galleries.
*   **`r88news.com` (11 Years | Clean) — The Trojan Horse:** High-authority sports news node used to bypass firewalls.
*   **`kuajievpn.com` (New | Clean) — Stealth Acquisition Gateway:** High-performance node capturing "GFW-bypass" search intent. 
    *   *Optimization Target:* Fix "Identical Meta Descriptions" (Bing warning) to boost CTR.

---

## 6. Tier 4: The Conversion Engines (Action & Intelligence)
*   **`000aa.com` (13 Years) — Bettor Intelligence Hub:** Daily Predictions & Player Reports. Pivot from "Scores" to "Bettor-Centric Insights."
*   **`nice3.com` (13 Years) — The Analytics Archive:** Historical odds comparison and league data since 2013.

---

## 7. The "Authority Loop" Workflow
1.  **Inject Authority:** Link from 15-year-old **Anchors** to a new **Vessel**. Google "blesses" the new domain with inherited trust.
2.  **Redirect Traffic:** Use **Clean Gateways** (`fytpress`, `kuajievpn`) to share match news or utility tools. Use QR codes/JS-redirects to pull users into the unblocked **Vessel**.
3.  **Validate Trust:** On the **Vessel**, show a "Verified by riche88.com" badge. Users can check the 15-year history (via VPN) to confirm they aren't on a scam site.
4.  **Lock-In:** Every site focuses on one goal: **App Download**. Once the user is in the App, the browser blocks no longer matter.

---

## 8. Roadmap to World Cup 2026
*   **Phase 1:** Finalize `riche88.com` (Museum). Hardcode canonicals to lock the authority.
*   **Phase 2:** Launch `riche88.net` (FAQ/Line Detection) to solve the "Where to play?" problem.
*   **Phase 3:** Update `000aa.com` with Bettor-Intelligence to capture pre-WC search intent.
*   **Phase 4:** Deploy the first fleet of **Vessels** and link them to the "Trust Circle."

## 10. Decision Log: Mirror & Linking Strategy

### Decision 1: Manual Silos over Automated Spinning
*   **Reasoning:** Automated content spinning (synonym swapping, color shifts) is high-risk cloaking that can trigger manual penalties from Google and Baidu.
*   **Implementation:** We use **Manual Editorial Choice**. Mirrors are 100% human-readable. We achieve uniqueness through programmatic, static elements like "Mirror Banners" and "Environment-Aware Titles."

### Decision 2: The "Silo Ring" Architecture
To handle the China GFW while maintaining PageRank, we use a two-tiered linking strategy:
1.  **Anchor Ring (Global):** `riche88.com` (15y) <-> `000aa.com` (13y). These high-authority domains endorse each other to maximize global juice.
2.  **Visibility Ring (Mainland):** `fyt1111.com` (Accessible) <-> `198rch.co` (Accessible). These unblocked mirrors link to each other to keep Chinese users in a functional loop.

### Decision 3: "Proof of Heritage" Bridge
*   **Reasoning:** Users on a mirror domain (`fyt1111.com`) need reassurance that it is official.
*   **Implementation:** Every mirror footer contains a low-key, visible link to the "Official 15-Year Archive" (`riche88.com`). Even if blocked, it acts as a "Seal of Authenticity."

### Decision 4: Self-Canonical Logic
*   **Reasoning:** Absolute canonicals pointing to blocked domains create "Dead Ends" for Baidu/Bing crawlers.
*   **Implementation:** Every domain uses a **Relative Canonical** (`.RelPermalink`). This allows mirrors to rank independently on Baidu while the original domains rank on Google.

### Decision 5: Stealth Link Obfuscation (Baidu Protection)
*   **Reasoning:** Baidu actively penalizes sites containing outbound links to known "harmful" or "blacklisted" industries. Even a simple `<a>` tag to a blocked master domain can trigger a ranking penalty for an unblocked mirror.
*   **Implementation:** All external and master/mirror bridge links are obfuscated using a "Nuclear" stealth pattern:
    *   **The Harmless Fallback:** We use real `<a>` tags but with `href` pointing to harmless internal pages (like `/origin/` or `/technology/`). This makes the site look functional and "white-hat" to simple crawlers.
    *   **The Cloaking:** The actual target URLs are never present in the HTML source. We use Hugo's `base64Encode` function to generate opaque strings in `data-base` attributes.
    *   **The Trigger:** A dedicated JavaScript handler (`links.js`) intercepts the click, prevents the harmless internal navigation, decodes the Base64 string at runtime, and opens the real target in a new tab.

### Decision 6: The Juice vs. Visibility Trade-off (One-Way Authority)
*   **Reasoning:** Direct outbound links to gambling or blocked domains pass "SEO Juice" (PageRank) but expose unblocked mirrors to Baidu's "Harmful Neighborhood" penalties. In the China market, user visibility (staying unblocked) is more valuable than outgoing PageRank transfer.
*   **Implementation (Single-Repo "Smart Bridge"):**
    *   **Logic:** We use runtime environment detection (`if (in .Permalink "riche88.com")`) to serve different HTML patterns from the same build.
    *   **Master (`riche88.com`):** Serves **Direct `<a>` tags**. This allows Google to crawl the links and "inject" 15 years of PageRank into the mirrors.
    *   **Mirrors (`fyt1111.com`, etc.):** Serve **Obfuscated Stealth Links**. Direct URLs are removed from the HTML source and replaced with Base64-encoded attributes. This ensures Baidu sees a "Clean" site with only harmless internal links, preventing association-based penalties.

### Decision 7: Keyword Reclamation & Entity Bridging
*   **Goal:** Force search engines to recognize the 15-year master domains as the primary authority for the keyword "富易堂", even when sub-brands (like `app.22fyt.com`) are currently ranking higher.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Keyword Leading:** Update Master/Mirror titles and H1s to lead with the primary keyword: *"富易堂官网"* (Riche88 Official).
    2.  **The "SameAs" Bridge:** Add currently top-ranking subdomains (e.g., `22fyt.com`) to the `sameAs` array in the `Organization` JSON-LD schema of the master domain.
    3.  **Cross-Domain Endorsement:** Add low-key "Verified Heritage" links on high-traffic landing pages pointing back to the unblocked brand mirror (`fyt1111.com`).
