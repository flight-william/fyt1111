# Project "Gold Mine": 15-Year Authority Empire
**Strategic Master Plan for FYTBET/Riche88 Ecosystem (2026 World Cup Edition)**

## 1. Executive Summary: The Authority Inversion
Stop viewing blocked domains as "broken." They are your **Nuclear Deterrent**. In an industry of "fly-by-night" sites, your cumulative **100+ years of domain age** is an unfair advantage that money cannot buy. We will use these **Anchors** to collect authority and "bless" unblocked **Vessels** to reach the China audience.

## 2. The "Anchor vs. Vessel" Strategy (China Survival)
This is the core architecture for dominating a restricted market:

### A. The Anchors (Permanent | High Trust | Often Blocked)
*   **Domains:** `riche88.com`, `riche88.net`, `000aa.com`, `nice3.com`, `riche99.com`.
*   **Role:** The "SEO Bank." They collect PageRank, historical authority, and E-E-A-T.
*   **Action:** They never change. They serve as the **Canonical Master** for the entire empire.

### B. The Vessels (Disposable | High Access | Unblocked)
*   **Domains:** New, cheap registrations (e.g., `fyt88.xyz`, `riche-go.top`).
*   **Role:** The "Interface." They deliver content to the user inside China.
*   **Action:** They host the frontend but point their `<link rel="canonical">` back to the Anchors. If blocked, discard and rotate to a new domain.

## 3. Tier 1: The Sovereign Core (Heritage & Canonical Anchor)
*   **`riche88.com` (15 Years) — The Museum:** Heritage, Charity, Mascot. Establishes the "Since 2011" proof.
*   **`riche99.com` (15 Years) — The Integrity Vault:** Scans of physical licenses and 15-year payout logs. Proves solvency.

---

## 4. Tier 2: The Knowledge Engine (Long-Tail & Support)
*   **`riche88.net` (15 Years) — The FAQ / Line Detection Hub:**
    *   **The Pivot:** A "Pure FAQ" site covering thousands of long-tail crypto/technical keywords.
    *   **The Edge:** Acts as the "Official Domain Registry" and "Line Tester" to direct users to unblocked mirrors.

---

## 5. Tier 3: The Traffic Harvesters (Organic & Stealth)
*   **`fytpress.com` (New | Clean) — The Newsroom:** Dominates 2026 World Cup keywords without betting terms. Bridges fans to the brand story.
*   **`caca818.com` (11 Years | Clean) — The Lifestyle Bridge:** The "Safe" link for social media bios. Home of "Ah Fu" comics and community galleries.

---

## 6. Tier 4: The Conversion Engines (Action & Intelligence)
*   **`000aa.com` (13 Years) — Bettor Intelligence Hub:** Daily Predictions & Player Reports. Pivot from "Scores" to "Bettor-Centric Insights."
*   **`nice3.com` (13 Years) — The Analytics Archive:** Historical odds comparison and league data since 2013.

---

## 7. The "Authority Loop" Workflow
1.  **Inject Authority:** Link from 15-year-old **Anchors** to a new **Vessel**. Google "blesses" the new domain with inherited trust.
2.  **Redirect Traffic:** Use **Clean Gateways** (`fytpress`) to share match news. Use QR codes/JS-redirects to pull users into the unblocked **Vessel**.
3.  **Validate Trust:** On the **Vessel**, show a "Verified by riche88.com" badge. Users can check the 15-year history (via VPN) to confirm they aren't on a scam site.
4.  **Lock-In:** Every site focuses on one goal: **App Download**. Once the user is in the App, the browser blocks no longer matter.

---

## 8. Roadmap to World Cup 2026
*   **Phase 1:** Finalize `riche88.com` (Museum). Hardcode canonicals to lock the authority.
*   **Phase 2:** Launch `riche88.net` (FAQ/Line Detection) to solve the "Where to play?" problem.
*   **Phase 3:** Update `000aa.com` with Bettor-Intelligence to capture pre-WC search intent.
*   **Phase 4:** Deploy the first fleet of **Vessels** and link them to the "Trust Circle."

**Status:** The "Gold Mine" is ready. Your age is your edge.
