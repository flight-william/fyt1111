# Project "Trust Hub": riche88.net Redo Plan
**Strategic Transformation of a 15-Year Authority Domain into an Institutional Integrity & Compliance Archive**

## 1. Vision & Business ROI
Transform `riche88.net` into an unbreakable "Source of Truth." This is not a "diary"; it is a **Business Weapon** designed for:
*   **Ad-Spend Displacement (SEO):** Capturing high-intent long-tail traffic for free via unique historical/technical data.
*   **VIP Conversion:** Providing the "Audit-Level Proof" required to close high-roller accounts (1M+ RMB).
*   **Brand Defense:** Suppressing "Black PR" by occupying the top search results with official technical resolutions.

## 2. Tone & Diplomacy Guidelines (The "Statesman" Tone)
To maintain institutional status, all content must follow these rules:
1.  **System-First:** Describe technical challenges (e.g., "volume spikes") rather than competitor failures.
2.  **Partner-Respect:** Frame provider glitches (e.g., BBIN) as shared technical anomalies resolved with a "Player-First" priority.
3.  **Institutional Vocabulary:** Use terms like "Integrity-Based Deferment" instead of "Blocking Funds" and "Coordinated Fraud Syndicates" instead of "Scammers."

## 3. Pillar 1: The "Anti-Scam" & Verification Shield
*Goal: Establish the .net as the Notary Public of the brand.*
*   **Official Domain Registry:** Searchable master list of all authorized brand assets.
*   **Verification Tool:** JS-based lookup for URLs and Telegram/Social IDs ("VERIFIED" vs "SCAM").
*   **Line Detection:** Real-time speed test directing China users to the fastest unblocked mirrors.

    *   **Forum Archives:** Find the exact text of official responses during historic PR incidents (Haiyan, Betboy, etc.).
    *   **Material Folder:** Locate physical artifacts (2011 licenses, physical event invites, original App v1.0 screenshots).
