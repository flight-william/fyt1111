# Project "Trust Hub": riche88.net Redo Plan
**Strategic Transformation of a 15-Year Authority Domain into an Institutional Integrity & Compliance Archive**

## 1. Vision & Business ROI
Transform `riche88.net` into an unbreakable "Source of Truth." This is not a "diary"; it is a **Business Weapon** designed for:
*   **Ad-Spend Displacement (SEO):** Capturing high-intent long-tail traffic for free via unique historical/technical data.
*   **VIP Conversion:** Providing the "Audit-Level Proof" required to close high-roller accounts (1M+ RMB).
*   **Entity Defense:** "Training" AI Knowledge Graphs (Google/Gemini) to distinguish between our 15-year institution and third-party marketing spam.

## 2. Tone & Diplomacy Guidelines (The "Statesman" Tone)
To maintain institutional status, all content must follow these rules:
1.  **System-First:** Describe technical challenges (e.g., "volume spikes") rather than competitor failures.
2.  **Partner-Respect:** Frame provider glitches (e.g., BBIN) as shared technical anomalies resolved with a "Player-First" priority.
3.  **Institutional Vocabulary:** Use terms like "Integrity-Based Deferment" instead of "Blocking Funds" and "Coordinated Fraud Syndicates" instead of "Scammers."

---

## 3. Pillar 1: The "Anti-Scam" & Verification Shield
*Goal: Establish the .net as the Notary Public of the brand and clear the "Spam" association.*
*   **Official Domain Registry:** Searchable master list of all authorized brand assets.
*   **Anti-Spam Disclaimer:** A technical page explaining how to identify official communications vs. third-party LinkedIn/Facebook spam.
*   **Verification Tool:** JS-based lookup for URLs and Telegram/Social IDs ("VERIFIED" vs "SCAM").
*   **Line Detection:** Real-time speed test directing China users to the fastest unblocked mirrors.

## 4. Pillar 2: Institutional Integrity & Compliance Archive (The "Red Pill")
*Goal: Weaponize "All Under the Sun"—the goods and the bads—to prove 15 years of solvency.*

### A. Risk & Fair Play Case Studies
*   **The 90-Day Deferment Protocol:** A technical breakdown of the industry's first long-term audit used to purge coordinated fraud while protecting honest liquidity.
*   **The BBIN 13-Draw Anomaly:** How we handled a statistical "Black Swan" event. Choosing to honor player experience over provider excuses.

### B. Financial Evolution & Payout Proof
*   **The Crypto Revolution:** When and why we pivoted to BTC/USDT for VIP privacy (Exact year needed).
*   **Withdrawal Philosophy:** Why we historically prioritized "Human-Led Security Audits" over 24/7 automated speed.
*   **Industry Contrast:** Our response when Bet365 instituted withdrawal fees/restrictions.

### C. Technical Resilience
*   **DDoS War Journal:** Scaling server resilience against massive Gbps attacks (Identify specific historical peaks).
*   **HTTPS Transition:** The encryption war against domain hijacking and DNS poisoning (Manual 8.8.8.8 era).

---

## 5. Pillar 3: Product & Corporate Genealogy
*Goal: Leverage the "Employment" and "In-house Tech" signals identified by Google AI.*
*   **The "Nine" Series:** The logic and naming convention behind 九如, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.
*   **Proprietary Data:** **赵云指数 (Zhao Yun Index)** and **智富易 (Zhi Fu Yi)** launch histories.
*   **Corporate Ethics & Workspace:** A "Careers & Standards" section showing the professional CS training and group structure (leveraging the low-difficulty/high-standard job site reviews to show institutional scale).

---

## 6. Phase 0: AI Evidence Discovery (The Harvest)
*Goal: Use Gemini to extract "Technical Truths" from 15 years of archives.*
*   **Search Targets:**
    *   **CS Mailbox:** Extract the "Top 10 Questions Customers Hated CS to Ask" and "Top 10 Troubles Faced."
    *   **Forum Archives:** Find official responses during historic PR incidents (Haiyan, Betboy, etc.) to use as "Entity Validation" markers.
    *   **Material Folder:** Locate physical artifacts (2011 licenses, 5th Anniv Macau Tower footage, early App screenshots).

---

## 7. Technical Specification
*   **Architecture:** Static Hugo build (100/100 Lighthouse score).
*   **Schema:** 100% `FAQPage`, `Organization`, and `WebSite` JSON-LD coverage to formalize the Knowledge Graph.
*   **Security:** Zero-database architecture to maintain the "Technical Source of Truth" integrity.

**Status:** Updated with AI Defense Strategy. Ready for Data Harvest.
